            <p>The key words "MUST" and "MUST NOT" in this document is to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. <a id="id1" class="footnote_reference" href="#rfc2119">1</a></p>

            <p>Zcash uses Ed25519 signatures as part of Sprout transactions. However, Ed25519 does not clearly define criteria for signature validity, and implementations conformant to RFC 8032 <a id="id2" class="footnote_reference" href="#rfc8032">2</a> need not agree on whether signatures are valid. This is unacceptable for a consensus-critical application like Zcash. Currently, Zcash inherits criteria for signature verification from an obsolete version of <cite>libsodium</cite>. Instead, this ZIP settles the situation by explicitly defining the Ed25519 verification criteria and changing them to be compatible with batch verification.</p>

            <p>The lack of clear verification criteria for Ed25519 signatures poses a maintenance burden. The initial implementation of Zcash consensus in <cite>zcashd</cite> inherited validation criteria from a then-current version of <cite>libsodium</cite> (1.0.15). Due to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2872#issuecomment-576911471">a bug in libsodium</a>, this was different from the intended criteria documented in the Zcash protocol specification <a id="id3" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">3</a> (before the specification was changed to match <cite>libsodium</cite> 1.0.15 in specification version 2020.1.2). Also, <cite>libsodium</cite> never guaranteed stable validation criteria, and changed behavior in a later point release. This forced <cite>zcashd</cite> to use an older version of the library before eventually patching a newer version to have consistent validation criteria. To be compatible, Zebra had to implement a special library, <cite>ed25519-zebra</cite> to provide Zcash-flavored Ed25519, attempting to match <cite>libsodium</cite> 1.0.15 exactly. And the initial attempt to implement <cite>ed25519-zebra</cite> was also incompatible, because it precisely matched the wrong compile-time configuration of <cite>libsodium</cite>.</p>
            <p>In addition, the validation criteria used by Zcash preclude the use of batch verification of Ed25519 signatures. While signature verification is not the primary bottleneck for Zcash, it would be nice to be able to batch-verify signatures, as is the case for RedJubJub.</p>

            <p>After activation of this ZIP, the
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{JoinSplitSig}\)</span>
             validation rules in ยง5.4.5 of the protocol specification <a id="id4" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">3</a> are changed to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="math">\(\underline{A}\)</span>

                 MUST be encodings of points
                    <span class="math">\(A\)</span>
                 and
                    <span class="math">\(R\)</span>
                 respectively on the Edwards form of Curve25519;</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="math">\(\underline{S}\)</span>
                 MUST represent an integer
                    <span class="math">\(S\)</span>
                 less than
                    <span class="math">\(\ell\)</span>
                ;</li>
                <li>The group equation
                    <span class="math">\([8][S]B = [8]R + [8][k]A\)</span>
                 MUST be satisfied, where
                    <span class="math">\(k\)</span>
                 and
                    <span class="math">\(B\)</span>
                 are defined as in RFC 8032 sections ยง5.1.7 and ยง5.1 respectively. <a id="id5" class="footnote_reference" href="#rfc8032">2</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The language about
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{ExcludedPointEncodings}\)</span>
             in ยง5.4.5 of the Zcash specification no longer applies.</p>
            <p>It is <em>not</em> required that
                <span class="math">\(\underline{A}\)</span>
             and
                <span class="math">\(\underline{R}\)</span>
             are canonical encodings; in other words, the integer encoding the
                <span class="math">\(y\)</span>
            -coordinate of the points may be unreduced modulo
                <span class="math">\(2^{255}-19\)</span>
            .</p>
            <p>Note: the alternate verification equation
                <span class="math">\([S]B = R + [k]A\)</span>
            , allowed by RFC 8032, MUST NOT be used.</p>

            <p>This change simplifies the Ed25519 validation logic and reduces future maintenance burden. Because multiplication by the cofactor admits more solutions to the verification equation, not fewer, it is compatible with all existing Ed25519 signatures on the chain.</p>
            <p>It also allows the use of batch verification, which requires multiplication by the cofactor in the verification equation.</p>

            <p>This change has no effect on honestly-generated signatures. Unlike the current validation rules, it makes it possible for a user to generate weak signing keys or to generate signing keys with nonzero torsion component and submit them to the blockchain. However, doing so provides them with no advantage, only compromise to their own security. Moreover, these cases are not a failure mode of any deployed implementation.</p>
