Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_

The terms "block chain", "consensus rule change", "branch", and "network
upgrade" are to be interpreted as defined in [#zip-0200]_.

The term "block target spacing" means the time interval between blocks targeted
by the difficulty adjustment algorithm in a given branch. It is normally
measured in seconds. (This is also sometimes called the "target block time",
but "block target spacing" is the term used in [#latest-protocol]_.)


Abstract
========

This proposal specifies a change in the block target spacing, to take effect in
the Blossom network upgrade [#zip-0206]_.

The emission schedule of mined ZEC will be approximately the same in terms of
time, but this requires the emission per block to be adjusted to take account
of the changed block target spacing.


Motivation
==========

The motivations for decreasing the block target spacing are:

- Reduced latency for considering transactions to be sufficiently confirmed;
- Greater throughput of transactions in unit time.

The latter goal could alternatively be achieved by increasing the block size
limit, but that would not also achieve the former goal.

Note that, for a given security requirement (in terms of the expected cost
distribution of a rollback attack), the number of confirmations needed
increases more slowly than the decrease in block time, and so, up to a point,
decreasing the block target spacing can provide a better trade-off between
latency and security. This argument assumes that the verification and
propagation time for a block remain small compared to the block target spacing.


Specification
=============

The changes described in this section are to be made in [#latest-protocol]_,
relative to the pre-Blossom specification in [#preblossom-protocol].

Throughout the specification, rename HalvingInterval to PreBlossomHalvingInterval,
and rename PoWTargetSpacing to PreBlossomTargetSpacing. These constants retain
their values from [#preblossom-protocol]_ of 840000 (blocks) and 150 (seconds)
respectively.

In section 2 (Notation), add BlossomActivationHeight and PostBlossomPoWTargetSpacing
to the list of integer constants.

In section 5.3 (Constants), define PostBlossomPoWTargetSpacing := 75 seconds.

For a given network (production or test), define BlossomActivationHeight as the height
at which Blossom activates on that network, as specified in [#zip-0206]_.

In section 7.6.3 (Difficulty adjustment), make the following changes:

Define IsBlossomActivated(height) to return true if height ≥ BlossomActivationHeight,
otherwise false.

This specification assumes that BlossomActivationHeight ≥ SlowStartInterval.

Define:

- BlossomPoWTargetSpacingRatio := PreBlossomPoWTargetSpacing / PostBlossomPoWTargetSpacing
- PostBlossomHalvingInterval := floor(PreBlossomHalvingInterval · BlossomPoWTargetSpacingRatio).

In the same section, redefine PoWTargetSpacing as a function taking a height parameter,
as follows:

- PoWTargetSpacing(height) :=

  - PreBlossomPoWTargetSpacing, if not IsBlossomActivated(height)
  - PostBlossomPoWTargetSpacing, otherwise.

Also redefine AveragingWindowTimespan, MinActualTimespan, MaxActualTimespan,
ActualTimespanDamped, ActualTimespanBounded, and Threshold as follows:

- add a height parameter to each of these functions that does not already
  have one;
- ensure that each reference to any of these values, or to PoWTargetSpacing,
  are replaced with a function call passing the height parameter.

In [#latest-protocol]_ section 7.7 (Calculation of Block Subsidy and Founders’
Reward), redefine the Halving and BlockSubsidy functions as follows:

- Halving(height) :=

  - floor((height - SlowStartShift) / PreBlossomHalvingInterval), if not IsBlossomActivated(height)
  - floor((BlossomActivationHeight - SlowStartShift) / PreBlossomHalvingInterval + (height - BlossomActivationHeight) / PostBlossomHalvingInterval), otherwise

- BlockSubsidy(height) :=

  - SlowStartRate · height, if height < SlowStartInterval / 2
  - SlowStartRate · (height + 1), if SlowStartInterval / 2 ≤ height and height < SlowStartInterval
  - floor(MaxBlockSubsidy / 2\ :sup:`Halving(height)`\ ), if SlowStartInterval ≤ height and not IsBlossomActivated(height)
  - floor(MaxBlockSubsidy / (BlossomPoWTargetSpacingRatio · 2\ :sup:`Halving(height)`\ )), otherwise

TODO: ideally, BlossomActivationHeight, PostBlossomHalvingInterval, and PostBlossomTargetSpacing should be chosen so that:

- (BlossomActivationHeight - SlowStartShift) / PreBlossomHalvingInterval + (height - BlossomActivationHeight) / PostBlossomHalvingInterval)
  is exactly 1 for some integer height.
- MaxBlockSubsidy / (BlossomPoWTargetSpacingRatio · 2\ :sup:`Halving(height)`\ )
  is an integer for the next few periods.

In [#latest-protocol]_ section 7.8 (Payment of Founders’ Reward), define:

- FounderAddressAdjustedHeight(height) :=

  - height, if not IsBlossomActivated(height)
  - BlossomActivationHeight + floor((height - BlossomActivationHeight) / BlossomPoWTargetSpacingRatio), otherwise

and in the definition of FounderAddressIndex, replace the use of height with FounderAddressAdjustedHeight(height).

Also define:

- FoundersRewardLastBlockHeight := max({ height ⦂ N | Halving(height) < 1 })

Replace the first note in that section with:

- No Founders’ Reward is required to be paid for height > FoundersRewardLastBlockHeight
  (i.e. after the first halving), or for height = 0 (i.e. the genesis block).

and in the second note, replace SlowStartShift + PreBlossomHalvingInterval - 1 with
FoundersRewardLastBlockHeight.


Effect on difficulty adjustment
-------------------------------

The difficulty adjustment parameters PoWAveragingWindow and PoWMedianBlockSpan
refer to numbers of blocks, but do *not* change at Blossom activation. This is
because the amount of damping/averaging required is expected to be roughly the
same, in terms of the number of blocks, after the change in block target
spacing.

The change in the effective value of PoWTargetSpacing will cause the block
spacing to adjust to the new target, at the normal rate for a difficulty
adjustment. The results of simulations are consistent with this expected
behaviour.


Non-consensus node behaviour
----------------------------

End-of-Service halt
'''''''''''''''''''

`zcashd` implements an "End-of-Service halt" behaviour that halts the node at a
block height that corresponds approximately to a given time after release. This
interval SHOULD be adjusted in releases where the End-of-Service halt time will
follow Blossom activation.


Default expiry delta
''''''''''''''''''''

When not overridden by the `-txexpirydelta` option, `zcashd` RPC calls that
create transactions use a default value for the number of blocks after which a
transaction will expire. The default in recent versions of `zcashd` is
20 blocks, which at the pre-Blossom block target spacing corresponds to roughly
50 minutes.

This default SHOULD change to BlossomPoWTargetSpacingRatio · 20 blocks after
Blossom activation, to maintain the approximate expiry time of 50 minutes.


TODO: check for any other number-of-block constants.


Deployment
==========

This proposal will be deployed with the Blossom network upgrade. [#zip-0206]_


Backward compatibility
======================

This proposal intentionally creates what is known as a "bilateral consensus
rule change". Use of this mechanism requires that all network participants
upgrade their software to a compatible version within the upgrade window.
Older software will treat post-upgrade blocks as invalid, and will follow any
pre-upgrade branch that persists.
