Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_

The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:

payment
  A transfer of funds implemented by a shielded or transparent output of 
  a single Zcash transaction.  


Abstract
========

This ZIP proposes a standard format for payment request URIs. Wallets that 
recognize this format enable users to construct payments simply by
clicking links on webpages or scanning QR codes.


Motivation
==========

In order for a robust transactional ecosystem to evolve for Zcash, it is
necessary for vendors to be able to issue requests for payment. At present, the
best option available is to manually specify a payment address, a payment
amount, and potentially memo field content. Of these three components, existing
wallets only provide functionality for reading payment addresses in a
semi-automated fashion. It is then necessary for the user to manually enter
payment amounts and any associated memo information, which is tedious and may
be error-prone, particularly if a payment is intended for multiple recipients
or the memo field information contains structured data that must be faithfully
reproduced. 

This ZIP seeks to eliminate these issues by proposing a standard format that
wallet vendors may support so that human intervention is required only for
approval, not creation, of such a payment transaction.

In Bitcoin, two different standards exist to permit vendors to issue payment
requests that are understood by wallets: BIP-0021 [#BIP0021]_ and BIP-0070
[#BIP0070]_.  BIP-0021 provides a URI format that can be interpreted by a
wallet to construct simple, single-recipient transactions; while BIP-0070 uses a
protobuf-based protocol that permits payment requests to specify the creation
of transactions of arbitrary complexity.

The format proposed in this ZIP seeks a middle ground between these approaches:
to provide a URI-based format which supports both the trivial use case and
the slightly-more-complex situation where a payment may be intended for
multiple recipients. 

Requirements
============

The format must be a valid URI.

The format must permit the representation of one or more (payment address, amount, 
memo) tuples.

Specification
=============

The following syntax specification uses ABNF [#RFC5234]_.

URI Syntax:

.. code-block:: EBNF

  zcashurn        = "zcash:" ( zcashaddress [ "?" zcashparams ] / "?" zcashparams )
  zcashaddress    = 1*base58
  zcashparams     = zcashparam [ "&" zcashparams ]
  zcashparam      = [ addrparam / amountparam / memoparam / messageparam / labelparam / reqparam / otherparam ]
  NONZERO         = %x31-39
  DIGIT           = %x30-39
  paramindex      = "." NONZERO *DIGIT
  addrparam       = "address" [ paramindex ] "=" zcashaddress
  amountparam     = "amount"  [ paramindex ] "=" 1*DIGIT [ "." 1*DIGIT ]
  labelparam      = "label"   [ paramindex ] "=" *qchar
  memoparam       = "memo"    [ paramindex ] "=" *base64url
  messageparam    = "message" [ paramindex ] "=" *qchar
  paramname       = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" )
  reqparam        = "req-" paramname [ paramindex ] [ "=" *qchar ]
  otherparam      = paramname [ paramindex ] [ "=" *qchar ]
  qchar           = unreserved / pct-encoded / allowed-delims / ":" / "@"
  allowed-delims  = "!" / "$" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";"

Here, ``ALPHA``, ``unreserved`` and ``pct-encoded`` are as defined in
[#RFC3986]_. "base58" is defined as in [#base58check]_. "base64url" is defined
as in [#base64url]_ with padding omitted.
   
A ZIP-321 URI represents a request for the construction of a transaction having
one or more *payments*. In the case that only a single payment is being
requested, the recipient address MAY be included in the ``hier-part`` component
of the RFC 3986 URI; otherwise, multiple recipient addresses can be specified
using ``addrparam`` parameters with different indices. 

Addresses, amounts, labels, and messages sharing the same ``paramindex`` are
interpreted to be associated with the same payment for the purposes of payment
construction. Parameters with an empty ``paramindex`` are associated with a
payment to the address with empty ``paramindex``.

A URI of the form ``zcash:<address>?...`` MUST be considered equivalent to a
URI of the form ``zcash:?address=<address>&...`` where ``<address>`` is an
instance of ``zcashaddress``.

If there are any non-address parameters having a given ``paramindex``, then 
the URI MUST contain an address parameter having that ``paramindex``.

Productions of the form ``1*x`` indicate one or more successive instances of the
production ``x``.

Transfer amount
---------------

If an amount is provided, it MUST be specified in decimal ZEC. Amounts MUST NOT
contain commas, and if a decimal fraction is present then a period (`.`) MUST be
used as the separating character to separate the whole number from the decimal
fraction. Both the whole number and the decimal fraction MUST be nonempty.
Leading zeros in the whole number or trailing zeros in the decimal fraction
are ignored. For example,
 * ``amount=50.00`` or ``amount=50`` or ``amount=050`` is treated as 50 ZEC;
 * ``amount=0.5`` or ``amount=00.500`` is treated as 0.5 ZEC; and
 * ``amount=50,000.00`` or ``amount=50,00`` or ``amount=50.`` or ``amount=.5``
   are invalid.

Query Keys
----------

label
   Label for an address (e.g. name of receiver)

address
   Zcash address string (shielded or transparent)

memo
   Contents for the Zcash shielded memo field. MUST not exceed 512 bytes.
   Parsers MUST consider the entire URI invalid if the address associated with
   the same ``paramindex`` is not a valid shielded address.

message
   Message that clients can display for the purpose of presenting descriptive
   information about the transaction to the user.

Examples
--------

Valid examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: 

  zcash:ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez?amount=1&memo=VGhpcyBpcyBhIHNpbXBsZSBtZW1vLg&message=Thank%20you%20for%20your%20purchase

A valid payment request for a payment of 1 ZEC to a single shielded address, with a base64url-encoded memo and a message for display by the wallet.

.. code-block:: 

  zcash:?address=tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU&amount=123.456&memo=eyAia2V5IjogIlRoaXMgaXMgYSBKU09OLXN0cnVjdHVyZWQgbWVtby4iIH0&address.1=ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez&amount.1=0.789&memo.1=VGhpcyBpcyBhIHVuaWNvZGUgbWVtbyDinKjwn6aE8J-PhvCfjok

A valid payment request with one transparent and one shielded recipient address, with encoded JSON and unicode memos.

Invalid Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: 

  zcash:?amount=3491405.05201255&address.1=ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez&amount.1=5740296.87793245

An invalid payment request; this is missing a payment address for the 0th payment index..

.. code-block:: 

  zcash:?address=tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU&amount=1&address=ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez&amount.1=2
  zcash:?address.1=tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU&amount=1&address.0=ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez&amount.1=2

Invalid payment requests; this contains more than one value for the 0th and 1st payment addresses, respectively.

Forward compatibility
---------------------

Variables which are prefixed with a ``req-`` are considered required. If a
parser does not recognize any variables which are prefixed with ``req-``, it
MUST consider the entire URI invalid. Any other variables that are not
recognized, but that are not prefixed with a ``req-``, SHOULD be ignored.

Backward compatibility
----------------------

As this ZIP is written, several clients already implement a ``zcash:`` URI
scheme similar to this one, however usually without the additional ``req-``
prefix requirement. Thus, it is RECOMMENDED that additional variables prefixed
with ``req-`` not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of 6
months from the finalization of this ZIP has passed in order to allow client
developers to release new versions, and users of old clients to upgrade.
