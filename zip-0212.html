            <p>This ZIP proposes a new note plaintext format for Sapling Outputs in transactions. The new format allows recipients to check the well-formedness of the emphemeral Diffie-Hellman key in the Output to avoid an assumption on zk-SNARK soundness for preventing diversified address linkability.</p>

            <p>The Sapling payment protocol contains a feature called "diversified addresses" which allows a single incoming viewing key to receive payments on an enormous number of distinct and unlinkable payment addresses. This feature allows users to maintain many payment addresses without paying additional overhead during blockchain scanning.</p>
            <p>The feature works by allowing payment addresses to become a tuple
                <span class="math">\((\mathsf{pk_d}, \mathsf{d})\)</span>
             of a public key
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{pk_d}\)</span>
             and
                <span class="math">\(88\)</span>
            -bit diversifier
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             such that
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{pk_d} = [\mathsf{ivk}] GH(\mathsf{d})\)</span>
             for some incoming viewing key
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{ivk}\)</span>
            . The hash function
                <span class="math">\(GH(\mathsf{d})\)</span>
             maps from a diversifier to prime order elements of the Jubjub elliptic curve. It is possible for a user to choose many
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             to create several distinct and unlinkable payment addresses of this form.</p>
            <p>In order to make a payment to a Sapling address, an ephemeral secret
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             is sampled by the sender and an ephemeral public key
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk} = [\mathsf{esk}] GH(\mathsf{d})\)</span>
             is included in the Output description. Then, a shared Diffie-Hellman secret is computed by the sender as
                <span class="math">\([\mathsf{esk}] [8] \mathsf{pk_d}\)</span>
            . The recipient can recover this shared secret without knowledge of the particular
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             by computing
                <span class="math">\([\mathsf{ivk}] [8] \mathsf{epk}\)</span>
            . This shared secret is then used as part of note decryption.</p>
            <p>Naively, the recipient cannot know which
                <span class="math">\((\mathsf{pk_d}, \mathsf{d})\)</span>
             was used to compute the shared secret, but the sender is asked to include the
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             within the note plaintext to reconstruct the note. However, if the recipient has more than one known address, an attacker could use a different payment address to perform secret exchange and, by observing the behavior of the recipient, link the two diversified addresses together. (This attacker strategy was discovered by Brian Warner earlier in the design of the Sapling protocol.)</p>
            <p>In order to prevent this attack, the protocol currently forces the sender to prove knowledge of the discrete logarithm of
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk}\)</span>
             with respect to the
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{g_d} = GH(\mathsf{d})\)</span>
             included within the note commitment. This
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{g_d}\)</span>
             is determined by
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             and recomputed during note decryption, and so the recipient will either be unable to decrypt the note or the sender will be unable to perform the attack.</p>
            <p>However, this check occurs as part of the zero-knowledge proof statement and so relies on the soundness of the underlying zk-SNARK in Sapling, and therefore it relies on relatively strong cryptographic assumptions and a trusted setup. It would be preferable to force the sender to transfer sufficient information in the note plaintext to allow deriving
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
            , so that, during note decryption, the recipient can check that
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk} = [\mathsf{esk}] \mathsf{g_d}\)</span>
             (for the expected
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{g_d}\)</span>
            ) and ignore the payment as invalid otherwise. This forms a line of defense in the case that soundness of the zk-SNARK does not hold.</p>
            <p>Merely sending
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             to the recipient in the note plaintext would require us to enlarge the note plaintext, but also would compromise the proof of IND-CCA2 security for in-band secret distribution. We avoid both of these concerns by using a key derivation to obtain both
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             and
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rcm}\)</span>

            <p>The attack that this prevents is an interactive attack that requires an adversary to be able to break critical soundness properties of the zk-SNARKs underlying Sapling. It is potentially valid to assume that this cannot occur, due to other damaging effects on the system such as undetectable counterfeiting. However, we have attempted to avoid any instance in the protocol where privacy (even against interactive attacks) depended on strong cryptographic assumptions. Acting differently here would be confusing for users that have previously been told that "privacy does not depend on zk-SNARK soundness" or similar claims.</p>
            <p>It is possible for us to infringe on the length of the <code>memo</code> field and ask the sender to provide
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             within the existing note plaintext without modifying the transaction format, but this would harm users who have come to expect a
                <span class="math">\(512\)</span>
            -byte memo field to be available to them. Changes to the memo field length should be considered in a broader context than changes made for cryptographic purposes.</p>
            <p>It is possible to transmit a signature of knowledge of a correct
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             rather than
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             itself, but this appears to be an unnecessary complication and is likely slower than just supplying
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
            .</p>

            <p>The changes made in this proposal prevent an interactive attack that could link together diversified addresses by only breaking the knowledge soundness assumption of the zk-SNARK. It is already assumed that the adversary cannot defeat the EC-DDH assumption of the Jubjub elliptic curve, for it could perform a linkability attack trivially in that case.</p>
            <p>In the naive case where the protocol is modified so that
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             is supplied directly to the recipient (rather than derived through
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rseed}\)</span>
            ) this would lead to an instance of key-dependent encryption, which is difficult or perhaps impossible to prove secure using existing security notions. Our approach of using a key derivation, which ultimately queries an oracle, allows a proof for IND-CCA2 security to be written by reprogramming the oracle to return bogus keys when necessary.</p>
