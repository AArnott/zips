Terminology
===========

The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", and \"MAY\" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.[^1]

The terms \"branch\" and \"network upgrade\" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in ZIP 200.[^2]

The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:

Overwinter

:   Code-name for the first Zcash network upgrade, also known as Network
    Upgrade Zero.

Abstract
========

This proposal defines an upgrade to the network handshake and peer
management required for network upgrades following the Network Upgrade
Activation Mechanism[^3].

Related to:

-   Transaction Signature Verification for Overwinter[^4].
-   Version 3 Transaction Format for Overwinter[^5].
-   Transaction Expiry[^6].

Motivation
==========

With scheduled network upgrades, at the activation height, nodes on each
branch should disconnect from nodes on other branches and only accept
new incoming connections from nodes on the same branch.

Specification
=============

When a new inbound connection is received or an outbound connection
created, a CNode object is instantiated with the version field set to
INIT\_PROTO\_VERSION which has a value of 209. This value is not
transmitted across the network, but for legacy reasons and technical
debt beyond the scope of this ZIP, this value will not be changed.

Once the two nodes have connected and started the handshake to negotiate
the protocol version, the version field of CNode will be updated. The
handshake[^7] involves \"version\" and \"verack\" messages being
exchanged.:

    L -> R: Send version message with the local peer's version
    R -> L: Send version message back
    R -> L: Send verack message
    R:      Sets version to the minimum of the 2 versions
    L -> R: Send verack message after receiving version message from R
    L:      Sets version to the minimum of the 2 versions

To send a version message, the node will invoke `PushVersion()`:

    void CNode::PushVersion() {
        ...
        PushMessage("version", PROTOCOL_VERSION, nLocalServices, nTime, addrYou, addrMe, ...);
        ...
    }

where `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is the highest protocol version supported by
the node.

Rejecting Pre-Overwinter Connections
------------------------------------

Currently, nodes will reject connections from peers with an advertised
protocol version lower than the other node\'s minimum supported protocol
version.

This value is defined as:

    //! disconnect from peers older than this proto version
    static const int MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION = 170002;

With rejection implemented as:

    if (pfrom->nVersion < MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION)
    {
        // disconnect from old peers running protocol version we don't support.

Activation of Overwinter will take place first on testnet, and if
successful, followed by mainnet.

To prepare for testnet activation, Overwinter nodes will contain the
following constants:

    static const int PROTOCOL_VERSION = 170003;
    static const int MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION = 170002;

Nodes running protocol version 170003 have a testnet activation height
set, but do not have a mainnet activation height set.

On testnet, a pre-Overwinter node is defined to be a node for which the
highest supported protocol version is \<= 170002.

These constants allow pre-Overwinter nodes that support protocol version
170002, and Overwinter nodes (which support both protocol versions
170002 and 170003 before Overwinter activation) to remain connected
until the activation.

To prepare for mainnet activation, Overwinter nodes will contain the
following constants:

    static const int PROTOCOL_VERSION = 170005;
    static const int MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION = 170002;

On mainnet, a pre-Overwinter node is defined to be a node for which the
highest supported protocol version is \<= 170004. (Nodes running
protocol version 170003 or 170004 do not have a mainnet activation
height set. The intermediate protocol version 170004 is used to indicate
support for the `NODE_BLOOM` service bit defined in[^8].)

These constants allow pre-Overwinter nodes that support protocol
versions 170002 to 170004 inclusive, and Overwinter nodes (which support
protocol versions 170002 to 170005 inclusive before Overwinter
activation) to remain connected until the activation.

As these constants cannot be changed at run-time, once Overwinter
activates on testnet or mainnet, Overwinter nodes should take steps to:

-   reject new connections from pre-Overwinter nodes;
-   disconnect any existing connections to pre-Overwinter nodes.

Network Coalescence
-------------------

Prior to the activation of Overwinter, nodes running a pre-Overwinter
protocol version (e.g. 170002) and the Overwinter protocol version
(170003 for testnet; 170005 for mainnet) remain connected with the same
consensus rules, but it is desirable for nodes supporting Overwinter to
connect preferentially to other nodes supporting Overwinter.

This is intended to help the network partition smoothly, since nodes
should already be connected to (a majority of) peers running the same
protocol version. Otherwise an Overwinter node may find their
connections to Sprout nodes dropped suddenly at the activation height,
potentially leaving them isolated and susceptible to eclipse
attacks.[^9]

To assist network coalescence before the activation height, we update
the eviction process to place a higher priority on evicting Sprout
nodes.

Currently, an eviction process takes place when new inbound connections
arrive, but the node has already connected to the maximum number of
inbound peers:

    if (nInbound >= nMaxInbound)
    {
        if (!AttemptToEvictConnection(whitelisted)) {
            // No connection to evict, disconnect the new connection
            LogPrint("net", "failed to find an eviction candidate - connection dropped (full)\n");
            CloseSocket(hSocket);
            return;
        }
    }

We update this process by adding behaviour so that the set of eviction
candidates will prefer pre-Overwinter nodes, when the chain tip is in a
period N blocks before the activation block height, where N is defined
as:

    /** The period before a network upgrade activates, where connections to upgrading peers are preferred (in blocks). */
    static const int NETWORK_UPGRADE_PEER_PREFERENCE_BLOCK_PERIOD = 24 * 24 * 3;

The eviction candidates can be modified as so:

    static bool AttemptToEvictConnection(bool fPreferNewConnection) {
    ...
    // Protect connections with certain characteristics
    ...
    // Check version of eviction candidates...
    // If we are connected to any pre-Overwinter nodes, keep them in the eviction set and remove any Overwinter nodes
    // If we are only connected to Overwinter nodes, continue with existing behaviour.
    if (nActivationHeight > 0 &&
        height < nActivationHeight &&
        height >= nActivationHeight - NETWORK_UPGRADE_PEER_PREFERENCE_BLOCK_PERIOD)
    {
        // Find any nodes which don't support Overwinter protocol version
        BOOST_FOREACH(const CNodeRef &node, vEvictionCandidates) {
            if (node->nVersion < params.vUpgrades[Consensus::UPGRADE_OVERWINTER].nProtocolVersion) {
                vTmpEvictionCandidates.push_back(node);
            }
        }

        // Prioritize these nodes by replacing eviction set with them
        if (vTmpEvictionCandidates.size() > 0) {
            vEvictionCandidates = vTmpEvictionCandidates;
        }
    }

The existing method of disconnecting a candidate remains:

> vEvictionCandidates\[0\]-\>fDisconnect = true;

The existing eviction process will classify and divide eviction
candidates into buckets called netgroups. If a netgroup only has one
peer, it will not be evicted. This means at least one pre-Overwinter
node will remain connected upto the activation block height, barring any
network issues or a high ban score.

Disconnecting Existing Connections
----------------------------------

At the activation block height, an Overwinter node may still remain
connected to pre-Overwinter nodes. Currently, when connecting, a node
can only perform the networking handshake once, where it sends the
version message before any other messages are processed. To disconnect
existing pre-Overwinter connections, `ProcessMessage` is modified so
that once Overwinter activates, if necessary, the protocol version of an
existing peer is validated when inbound messages arrive.

Example code:

    bool static ProcessMessage(CNode* pfrom, string strCommand, CDataStream& vRecv, int64_t nTimeReceived)
        ...
        else if (pfrom->nVersion == 0)
        {
            // Must have a version message before anything else
            Misbehaving(pfrom->GetId(), 1);
            return false;
        }
        else if (strCommand == "verack")
        {
            ...
        }

        // Disconnect existing peer connection when:
        // 1. The version message has been received
        // 2. Overwinter is active
        // 3. Peer version is pre-Overwinter
        else if (NetworkUpgradeActive(GetHeight(), chainparams.GetConsensus(), Consensus::UPGRADE_OVERWINTER)
                && (pfrom->nVersion < chainparams.GetConsensus().vUpgrades[Consensus::UPGRADE_OVERWINTER].nProtocolVersion))
        {
            LogPrintf("peer=%d using obsolete version %i; disconnecting\n", pfrom->id, pfrom->nVersion);
            pfrom->PushMessage("reject", strCommand, REJECT_OBSOLETE,
                                strprintf("Version must be %d or greater",
                                chainparams.GetConsensus().vUpgrades[Consensus::UPGRADE_OVERWINTER].nProtocolVersion));
            pfrom->fDisconnect = true;
            return false;
        }

Deployment of Overwinter
========================

The Overwinter network upgrade defines the following network upgrade
constants[^10]:

BRANCH\_ID

:   `0x5ba81b19`

ACTIVATION\_HEIGHT

:   Testnet: 207500

    Mainnet: 347500

The following ZIPs are deployed by Overwinter:

-   ZIP 200[^11]
-   ZIP 201 (this ZIP)
-   ZIP 202[^12]
-   ZIP 203[^13]
-   ZIP 143[^14]

Backward compatibility
======================

Prior to the network upgrade activating, Overwinter and pre-Overwinter
nodes are compatible and can connect to each other. However, Overwinter
nodes will have a preference for connecting to other Overwinter nodes,
so pre-Overwinter nodes will gradually be disconnected in the run up to
activation.

Once the network upgrades, even though pre-Overwinter nodes can still
accept the numerically larger protocol version used by Overwinter as
being valid, Overwinter nodes will always disconnect peers using lower
protocol versions.
