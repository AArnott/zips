            <p>This ZIP defines a new encoding for transparent Zcash addresses. Wallets must ensure that no shielded notes are spent in transactions that send to a transparent address encoded in the specified fashion.</p>
            <p>This ZIP is presently in Draft status, and defines two alternate encodings for consideration. Analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of each of the proposed alternatives is presented at the end of this document.</p>

            <p>In November of 2023, the Zcash community received notice from the Binance cryptocurrency exchange that Zcash was at risk of being delisted from the exchange unless the community could provide a mechanism by which Binance could refuse deposits from shielded addresses and return them to the depositor. This issue was raised and discussed at length in the Zcash Community forum <a id="footnote-reference-2" class="footnote_reference" href="#binance-delisting">2</a>.</p>
            <p>In the course of that discussion thread, wallet developer and community member @hanh <a id="footnote-reference-3" class="footnote_reference" href="#hanh-profile">3</a> suggested a wallet-oriented approach <a id="footnote-reference-4" class="footnote_reference" href="#hanh-suggestion">4</a> that involved defining a new encoding for Zcash transparent P2PKH addresses. A Consumer of such an address, whether it be a wallet or an exchange, could recognize this encoding as a directive that the wallet should only spend transparent funds when creating an output to that address.</p>

            <p>The Binance cryptocurrency exchange requires that funds sent to their deposit addresses come from source addresses that are readily identifiable using on-chain information, such that if necessary funds may be rejected by sending them back to the source address(es). This ZIP is intended to standardize a transparent address encoding that is not yet understood by preexisting Consumers, in order to prevent inadvertent shielded spends when sending to such addresses. Then, Consumers that upgrade to support the new encoding will do so with the understanding that they must respect the restrictions on sources of funds described in this ZIP.</p>

                <p>Traceable Unified Addresses fit into the existing Zcash Unified Address ecosystem. Existing Consumers that support Unified Addresses will automatically be able to recognize a Traceable Unified Address as a valid Zcash address, but will not be able to send to that address unless they update their code to understand the new Receiver Typecode defined in this ZIP. Even in the case that Traceable Receivers are not understood by the sending wallet, a Unified Address-supporting wallet will be able to automatically provide good error messages for their users to indicate that the wallet needs to be updated to understand and send to these addresses.</p>
                <p>In addition, by integrating with the Unified Address framework, it becomes possible for the addresses being generated to include extra metadata, in particular, metadata items such as an Address Expiry Height or Address Expiry Date <a id="footnote-reference-10" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0316-address-expiry">7</a> may be included. For exchange use cases such as Binance's, it is useful to ensure that an address provided to a user has a limited utility life, such that after expiration the user must obtain a new address in order to be able to continue to send funds <a id="footnote-reference-11" class="footnote_reference" href="#binance-address-expiry">9</a>.</p>

                <pre>A Unified Address MUST contain at least one Receiver and any number
of Metadata Items. The selection of Receivers is further restricted
such that a Unified Address MUST **either** contain at least one shielded
Receiver (Typecodes :math:`\mathtt{0x02}` and :math:`\mathtt{0x03}`), OR
MUST contain **only** a Traceable Address Receiver (Typecode
:math:`\mathtt{0x04}`).

A Unified Viewing Key MUST contain at least one shielded Item (Typecodes

                <ul>
                    <li>Existing wallets and other Consumers will regard the new address type as entirely invalid, and will not automatically prompt their users that they need to upgrade in order to send to this type of address.</li>
                    <li>Creation of a new fully-distinct address type further fragments the Zcash address ecosystem. Avoiding such fragmentation and providing smooth upgrade paths and good error messages to users is exactly the problem that Unifed Addresses <a id="footnote-reference-18" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0316-unified-addresses">5</a> were intended to avoid.</li>
                    <li>The TEX address type does not provide any mechanism for address expiration. One of the questions Binance has asked has been what to do about users who have stored their existing transparent deposit address in their wallets, or as a withdrawal address for other exchanges or services. This is a challenging problem to mitigate now because address expiration was not previously implemented. We should not further compound this problem by defining a new distinct address type that does not provide a mechanism for address expiry.</li>
