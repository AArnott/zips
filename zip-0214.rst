Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_

The term "Zcash" in this document is to be interpreted as described in the
Zcash Trademark Donation and License Agreement ([#trademark]_ or successor
agreement).

The term "network upgrade" in this document is to be interpreted as
described in ZIP 200 [#zip-0200]_ and the Zcash Trademark Donation and License
Agreement ([#trademark]_ or successor agreement).

The terms "block subsidy" and "halving" in this document are to be interpreted
as described in sections 3.9 and 7.7 of the Zcash Protocol Specification.
[#protocol]_

The terms "Electric Coin Company" (or "ECC"), "Zcash Foundation" (or "ZF"),
"Major Grants", "ECC slice", "ZF slice", and "MG slice" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in ZIP 1014 [#zip-1014]_.

The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:

${NU4}
  Code-name for the fifth Zcash network upgrade, also known as Network Upgrade 4.
Testnet
  The Zcash test network, as defined in [#protocol]_.
Mainnet
  The Zcash production network, as defined in [#protocol]_.


Abstract
========

This ZIP describes consensus rule changes interpreting the proposed structure of
the Zcash Development Fund, which is to be enacted in Network Upgrade 4 and last
for 4 years.


Applicability
=============

This ZIP concerns the Zcash Mainnet and Testnet, and is not intended to be
applicable to other blockchains using Zcash technology.


Motivation
==========

Motivation for the Zcash Development Fund itself is considered in ZIP 1014
[#zip-1014]_, which gives a high-level description of the intended structure of
the fund.

An important motivation for describing the consensus rules in a separate ZIP is
to avoid making unintended changes to ZIP 1014, which has already been agreed
between ECC, ZF, and the Zcash community. This facilitates critically assessing
whether the consensus rule changes accurately reflect the intent of ZIP 1014.


Requirements
============

The primary requirement of this ZIP is to make changes to consensus rules necessary
and sufficient to implement the intent of ZIP 1014.

The Zcash Development Fund distributes funding in ZEC obtained from block subsidies
on Mainnet. This ZIP should also specify corresponding rules, addresses, and
activation height for Testnet, in order to allow testing and auditing of the design
and implementation within sufficient lead time before activation on Mainnet.


Non-requirements
================

This ZIP is not required to enforce provisions of ZIP 1014 that fall outside what
is implementable by Zcash consensus rules.


Specification
=============

The Blossom network upgrade changed the height of the first halving to block height
1046400 [#zip-0208]_, as a consequence of reducing the block target spacing from
150 seconds to 75 seconds.

Since ZIP 1014 specifies that the Zcash Development Fund starts at the first halving,
the activation height of ${NU4} on Mainnet therefore SHALL be 1046400.

ZIP 207 [#zip-0207]_ SHALL be activated in ${NU4}.

The following funding streams are defined for Mainnet:

  ========== =========== ============= ============== ============
    Stream    Numerator   Denominator   Start height   End height
  ========== =========== ============= ============== ============
  ``FS_ECC``      7           100          1046400       2726400
  ``FS_ZF``       5           100          1046400       2726400
  ``FS_MG``       8           100          1046400       2726400
  ========== =========== ============= ============== ============

The funding streams are defined for Testnet are identical except that the
start height of each stream is the activation height of ${NU4} on Testnet, i.e.
xxxxxxx.

Note: on Testnet, the activation height of ${NU4} will be before the first halving.
Therefore, the consequence of the above rules for Testnet is that the amount sent
to each Zcash Development Fund recipient address will initially (before Testnet
block height 1046400) be double the corresponding initial amount on Mainnet. This
reduces to the same amount as on Mainnet, from Testnet block heights 1046400
(inclusive) to 2726400 (exclusive).


Dev Fund Recipient Addresses
----------------------------

For each of Testnet and Mainnet, before deploying this ZIP in a node implementation
with the activation height set for that network, each of the parties (ECC and ZF)
SHALL generate sequences of independent recipient addresses to be used for each
stream in each funding period:

* ECC SHALL generate the addresses for the ``FS_ECC`` funding stream, which on
  Mainnet corresponds to the **ECC slice**;
* ZF SHALL generate the addresses for the ``FS_ZF`` and ``FS_MG`` funding streams,
  which on Mainnet correspond to the **ZF slice** and **MG slice** respectively.

Funds sent to each Mainnet funding stream SHALL be governed by all requirements on
the corresponding slice specified in ZIP 1014 [#zip-1014]_.

No requirements are imposed on the use of funds sent to Testnet funding streams.


Direct-grant option
'''''''''''''''''''

ZIP 1014 specifies a "direct-grant option" by which, if agreed upon by both ECC
and ZF before ${NU4} activation, some portion of the **MG slice** may be directly
assigned to the grantee(s), rather than accepted and disbursed by ZF. [#zip-1014]_

The funding stream mechanism allows for this option by adding a funding stream
corresponding to each direct grantee, with addresses generated by ZF. In this case
the total amount of funding streams assigned to direct grantees MUST be subtracted
from the funding stream for the remaining **MG slice** (or, if all Major Grants are
direct, replace the funding stream for the **MG slice**).

For each network upgrade after ${NU4} requiring modifications to the set of direct
grantees, a separate ZIP would be published specifying those modifications.
