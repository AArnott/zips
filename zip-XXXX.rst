Motivation
==========

Who am I?
---------

My name is Matt Luongo. I'm an entrepreneur who's been full-time in the crypto
space since 2014, co-founding Fold, a Bitcoin payments company, and more
recently Keep, a private computation startup built on Ethereum. I've built some
`around Zcash <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2129>`_, and we've
considered investing more heavily in Zcash development on our latest project.

I'm deeply interested in privacy tech. For me, privacy is about consent --
consent to know my habits, beliefs, and preferences -- and I see privacy as
the next frontier in our pursuit of an economy that respects individual choice.

My perspective is as the founder of a for-profit company focused on building
self-sovereign technologyi who would like to develop on Zcash. We work in this
space ideologically, but our work isn't free; attracting and growing talent
requires funding.

If you're interested in more on my background, I've introduced myself more
`properly on the forum
<https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/introducing-matt-luongo-from-keep/34947>`_.

What's this about?
------------------

Since Zcon1, I've been looking to fund work to build an Ethereum / Zcash bridge.
I've spoken to the ECC, the Zcash Foundation, and a number of early Zcash
community members on how best to move forward with this project, and in the
process I've learned a lot about how the community works and dev governance has
been structured thus far.

Inevitably, I've become interested in the community's proposals for a new dev
fee, and thought about how the right structure might support work like ours.

I believe the Zcash community has an opportunity to deploy a new incentive
structure that will attract companies like ours to build and improve Zcash,
leading to a more resilient network, stronger technology, and wider usage.
