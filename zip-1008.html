            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>The key words "MUST" and "MUST NOT" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. <a href="#rfc2119" id="id1" class="footnote_reference">2</a></p>
            <p>For clarity this ZIP defines these terms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spirit is defined as what is the intended outcome of the ZIP. <a href="#spirit" id="id2" class="footnote_reference">1</a></li>

            <h2>Out of Scope for this Proposal</h2>
            <p>Everything except moving the development fund end date.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="abstract">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The spirit of this proposal is to keep to the current structure of the Electric Coin Company (ECC) receiving funding from the block distribution for two years' worth of blocks after the first halving in October 2020.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="motivation">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>To give more time to work out the full ramifications of any potential pivot / slow down, yet keep "all in on ZEC" for two more years with as little disruption as possible.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="requirements">
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>Nothing about distribution recipients changes.</p>
            <p>[Editor's notes: The current distribution of the Foundersâ€™ Reward is dependent on arrangements between the participants that will, if not explicitly renewed, expire at the first halving. There are currently direct and indirect recipients other than the ECC and Zcash Foundation. It is unclear whether funding of the ECC and Foundation is intended to continue at the current absolute ZEC rate, or at the same rate relative to the block subsidy which halves in October 2020. Further specification would be needed in order to fulfil and clarify the spirit of the proposal.]</p>
        </section>
        <section id="specification">
            <h2>Specification</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The ECC's portion of block subsidy MUST be capped at their projected 1.1m USD costs a month.</li>
                <li>The ECC's portion of block subsidy MUST NOT be greater than 10% of total block subsidy of any one block.</li>
                <li>This MUST end at a block height corresponding to two years after the first halving, i.e. October 2022.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>[Editor's notes: The 1.1m USD cap cannot be specified as a consensus rule since there is no on-chain oracle for the USD price. Provisions that referred to specific block heights have been revised since they were inconsistent with the change in block target spacing <a href="#zip-0208" id="id3" class="footnote_reference">4</a> that will occur with the Blossom Network Upgrade <a href="#zip-0206" id="id4" class="footnote_reference">3</a>; and even if recalculated, fixed block heights would potentially be inconsistent with future changes in target block spacing.]</p>
