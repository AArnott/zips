Terminology
===========

The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", and \"MAY\" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.[^1]

The terms \"branch\" and \"network upgrade\" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in ZIP 200.[^2]

The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:

Sapling

:   Code-name for the second Zcash network upgrade, also known as
    Network Upgrade 1.

Abstract
========

This proposal defines the deployment of the Sapling network upgrade. In
addition, it describes a hard fork that occurred on testnet to allow
\"minimum-difficulty\" blocks.

Specification
=============

Sapling deployment
------------------

The primary sources of information about Sapling consensus protocol
changes are:

-   The Zcash Protocol Specification[^3].
-   Transaction Signature Verification for Sapling[^4].
-   Network Upgrade Activation Mechanism[^5].

The network handshake and peer management mechanisms defined in[^6] also
apply to this upgrade.

The following network upgrade constants[^7] are defined for the Sapling
upgrade:

BRANCH\_ID

:   `0x76b809bb`

ACTIVATION\_HEIGHT (Sapling)

:   Testnet: 280000

    Mainnet: 419200

On testnet, Sapling had activated prior to this height, but that branch
was rolled back. A subsequent hard fork occurred on testnet, changing
the difficulty algorithm to accept \"minimum-difficulty\" blocks under
certain conditions starting at block height 299188.

On both mainnet and testnet, Sapling-compatible nodes MUST advertise
protocol version 170007 or later. The minimum peer protocol version that
Sapling-compatible nodes will connect to, remains 170002.

Pre-Sapling nodes are defined as nodes advertising a protocol version
less than 170007.

Approximately three days (defined in terms of block height) before the
Sapling activation height, Sapling-compatible nodes will change the
behaviour of their peer connection logic in order to prefer pre-Sapling
peers for eviction from the set of peer connections.

> /\*\* The period before a network upgrade activates, where connections
> to upgrading peers are preferred (in blocks). */ static const int
> NETWORK\_UPGRADE\_PEER\_PREFERENCE\_BLOCK\_PERIOD = 24* 24 \* 3;

The implementation is similar to that for Overwinter which was described
in [^8].

Once Sapling activates on testnet or mainnet, Sapling nodes should take
steps to:

-   reject new connections from pre-Sapling nodes;
-   disconnect any existing connections to pre-Sapling nodes.

Change to difficulty adjustment on testnet
------------------------------------------

Section 7.6.3 of[^9] describes the algorithm used to adjust the
difficulty of a block (defined in terms of a \"target threshold\") based
on the `nTime` and `nBits` fields of preceding blocks.

This algorithm changed on testnet, starting from block 299188, to allow
\"minimum-difficulty\" blocks. If the block time of a block from this
height onward is at least 15 minutes after that of the preceding block,
then the block is a minimum-difficulty block, and its target threshold
is set to the value of PoWLimit for testnet (see[^10] section 5.3).
However, its `nBits` field is still computed according to the original
difficulty adjustment algorithm.

This does not affect how the minimum-difficulty block is treated for
subsequent difficulty adjustments. In particular, only the `nBits` field
computed by the original algorithm is used for the purpose of computing
the MeanTarget values from which subsequent difficulty changes are
calculated.

This change does not affect mainnet.

Backward compatibility
======================

Prior to the network upgrade activating, Sapling and pre-Sapling nodes
are compatible and can connect to each other. However, Sapling nodes
will have a preference for connecting to other Sapling nodes, so
pre-Sapling nodes will gradually be disconnected in the run up to
activation.

Once the network upgrades, even though pre-Sapling nodes can still
accept the numerically larger protocol version used by Sapling as being
valid, Sapling nodes will always disconnect peers using lower protocol
versions.

Support in zcashd
=================

Support for Sapling consensus rules was implemented in zcashd version
2.0.0. The majority of support for RPC calls and persistence of Sapling
z-addresses was implemented in version 2.0.1. Both of these versions
advertise protocol version 170007.
